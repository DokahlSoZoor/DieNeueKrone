Cage film's third week at US top

Nicolas Cage movie National Treasure has topped the US and Canada box office for the third week in a row.

National Treasure made dollars 17.1m (pounds 8.8m) in ticket sales from Friday to Sunday, according to studio estimates, taking its total to dollars 110.2m (pounds 56.7m). Comedy Christmas with the Kranks, starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, was in second place. The Polar Express entered in third place while Jude Law film Closer made its debut at number six.

Oliver Stone's big-budget epic Alexander, starring Colin Farrell, followed last week's disappointing sixth-place opening with a slump to seventh place and takings of dollars 4.7m (pounds 2.4m). Critics have savaged the three-hour epic, which reportedly cost dollars 150m (pounds 77m) to make. National Treasure, which sees Cage's character Ben Gates chase a hidden fortune, has been made by Disney Studios. It is Cage's fourth collaboration with Jerry Bruckheimer, who is usually noted for his male-orientated action films.
